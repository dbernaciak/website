I am a second-year PhD Student in Statistical Science at the [Department of Statistical Science, University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/), under the supervision of [Jim Griffin](https://jimegriffin.github.io/website/) and [Adam Smith](https://www.adamnsmith.com/) (intake: September 2020). I work as a Data Scientist at J.P. Morgan. I graduated with a Master of Science in Data Science in 2020 from the [Department of Statistical Science, University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/) and with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics in 2015 from the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/).

My research involves development of methodologies for Bayesian time series model synthesis with particular focus on Bayesian Nonparametric methods.
